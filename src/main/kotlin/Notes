1 ---> Set as your DLS should look like
2 ---> Create function with lambda as parameter
3 ---> Use that function with lambda outside of parentheses
4 ---> Get rid of the "it" by changing the lambda block into a lambda with receiver
4' ---> We can one-line the expression using apply
5 ---> In order to use val and have proper data class, setup Builder Pattern for those data class
6 ---> Move Object creation functions in model class Builder
7 ---> List of Object ? Say no more... Create a collection object in the builder change the function to be an "add" of item to the collection
8 ---> Wanna change the collection style ? Create helper class. Subclass of list (of the object we want to create)
9 ---> Protect the DSL safety by scoping it with @DslMarker based annotation
